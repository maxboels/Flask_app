You are to write a program that accepts numerical calculations in prefix notation, such as + 5 7 or - 12 * 2 6
You can make the following assumptions:
The system should support the operators +, -, *, / which all take exactly two args.
The input literals are positive integers.
Calculations can be done in the floating-point or integer domain.
Handling division by zero is unimportant; the program can crash or do anything if that arises.
You don't need to consider operator presidence
You are free to use any programming language of choice but please provide any requirements to run the code EG: Python version or Pip dependencies
